# CircleCI Training Kōans

> _kōan_ (noun): a paradoxical anecdote or riddle, used in Zen Buddhism to demonstrate the inadequacy of logical reasoning and to provoke enlightenment.

In this repo, you will find a series of challenges of increasing difficulty related to CircleCI 2.1 configs. There is one challenge per folder; each challenge will include its own instructions via a `README.md`.

# How to follow along?

The best way to follow along is to create a new repository on your personal GitHub account for the purpose of running tests. You can copy the config files from each challenge into your own CircleCI project to test if the new config works.

_side note_: If you come across an issue with a config that isn't directly related to the challenge, consider it a learning opportunity, unless it is related to an underlying change to the platform.

# Keep a log

Each challenge will ask you to record the link to the workflow or job where you have completed the challenge.

 Good luck!
